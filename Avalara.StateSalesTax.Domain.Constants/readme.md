# Project: Domain.Constants

## Purpose

This is just a place for project specific constants I needed to reference for setting up the solution.

I could have moved more stuff here (like the FIPS Code identifiers), but didn't to save for time.

It's good practice to limit the freeform use of strings in the application and to either put them in a resource file or a static constants class and reference them from there.

# Avalara.StateSalesTax
A repo for the code exercise for Avalara interview candidates.

This repo is built with dependency injection, service-contract and n-tiered architecture patterns, entity framework core, and has full test coverage at the API and Service class levels.

Each individual project (except the test projects) includes a readme describing the general purpose of the given project.

In order to run the WebAPI project, you will first need to follow the instructions in the Data.EntityFramework project to generate the Sqlite database.

Please feel free to reach out to me at barnhouset09@gmail.com if you have any questions!
